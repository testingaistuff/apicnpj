# Documentation: SupplierList Component

## Overview
The `SupplierList` component is a React functional component designed to display a list of suppliers. It fetches supplier data from a backend service and renders it dynamically. The component also provides a reload functionality to refresh the supplier list.

## Technology Overview

### Imports and Packages
| **Import/Package** | **Description** |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| `React`            | A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used here to create a functional component and manage state and lifecycle methods. |
| `useEffect`        | A React Hook that allows side effects (e.g., data fetching) to be performed in functional components. |
| `useState`         | A React Hook for managing state in functional components. |
| `getAllSuppliers`  | A function imported from `supplierService` that retrieves the list of suppliers from the backend. |
| `createSupplier`   | A function imported from `supplierService` that allows the creation of new suppliers. Although imported, it is not utilized in this component. |

## Component Structure

### Data Structures
The component uses the following data structure:
- **State Variable**: `suppliers`  
  - Type: Array  
  - Purpose: Stores the list of suppliers fetched from the backend.

### Logic
1. **State Initialization**:  
   The `suppliers` state is initialized as an empty array using the `useState` hook.

2. **Data Fetching**:  
   - The `fetchSuppliers` function is an asynchronous function that calls `getAllSuppliers` to fetch supplier data from the backend.
   - On success, the response is stored in the `suppliers` state using `setSuppliers`.
   - Errors during the fetch are logged to the console.

3. **Lifecycle Management**:  
   - The `useEffect` hook is used to call `fetchSuppliers` when the component is mounted. This ensures the supplier list is loaded when the component is first rendered.

4. **Rendering**:  
   - The component renders a header (`Supplier List`) and a button (`Reload`) to manually refresh the supplier list.
   - The supplier data is displayed as a list (`<ul>`), with each supplier represented as a list item (`<li>`). The supplier details include:
     - `nome` (Name)
     - `cnpj` (Tax Identification Number)
     - `nomeContato` (Contact Name)
     - `emailContato` (Contact Email)
     - `telefoneContato` (Contact Phone)

## Insights

### Component Behavior
- **Dynamic Data Handling**: The component dynamically fetches and updates supplier data, making it suitable for real-time applications.
- **Error Handling**: Errors during data fetching are logged to the console, but no user-facing error handling is implemented. This could be improved by displaying an error message in the UI.
- **Unused Import**: The `createSupplier` function is imported but not utilized in the component. This may indicate future plans for supplier creation functionality or an oversight.

### Scalability
- **State Management**: The component uses local state (`useState`) for managing supplier data. For larger applications, consider using a global state management solution like Redux or Context API.
- **Performance**: The `fetchSuppliers` function is called every time the `Reload` button is clicked. If the supplier list is large, this could impact performance. Implementing pagination or lazy loading could improve efficiency.

### Accessibility
- The component does not include accessibility features such as ARIA roles or labels. Adding these would improve usability for users with disabilities.

### Internationalization
- The component uses hardcoded text (`Supplier List`, `Reload`). For applications targeting multiple languages, consider using an internationalization library like `react-intl`.
